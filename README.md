Introduction

This project consists of creating a simple breathalyzer device, with the aim of detecting and signaling the presence of alcohol vapors in exhaled air. The project uses an alcohol sensor (MQ-3), three signaling LEDs, a buzzer for audible warning and an OLED display for displaying the measured value and a rotary encoder for controlling the device.
The goal of the project is to create an affordable, portable and easy-to-use device, for personal use (for example, before driving).

The idea started from the desire to combine an analog sensor with visual and audible feedback elements, to create a functional system for rapid non-invasive alcohol assessment, without complicated displays or high energy consumption.
